`# Dustin's Intro to ReactJS`,

`# Thanks for having me!`,

`# Topics to cover

 * React basics
 * Toolchain basics
 * Building a gif search panel`,
  
`# React basics
## React is a library, *not* a framework
 * You can easily port parts of your app over
 * Primarily responsible for the view
 * Can take a dependency on other libraries to handle routing, storage of application state, etc.
 * React is not a silver bullet, in some cases it may be better to stick to what you've got instead of introducing another library`,

`# The biggest win?
## Very easy to build UI and manage UI state`,

`# Other nice wins

 * Sanitization out of the box
 * Server side rendering
 * Easy ASP.NET MVC integration`,

`# Have you ever tried to JQuery?`,

`# How about when there was lots of UI manipulation?`,

`# DOM Manipulation is hard`,

`# What is an application, really?`,

`# Application container
 * Widget
    * Slider on widget
    * Another slider
 * Widget
    * Button
`,

`# Component
 * Component
  * Component
  * Component

`,

`# Javascript and HTML, in the same component

 * ES6 modules have fixed dependency woes in Javascript
   * \`var jquery = window.jQuery\` â†’ \`import jQuery from 'jquery'\`
 * Makes it very easy to see how the HTML updates when state or props change
 * Components can be self-contained`,

`# Every component has its own state and props

## State: mutable
## Props: immutable`,

`# Example

    <GifResult staticImage={this.state.currentImage.static} animatedImage={this.state.currentImage.animated} />
    
## staticImage and animatedImage are props`,

`# Call setState to update the component and its children

 * This is where the magic happens
 * React will compute the new tree by rendering virtual DOM nodes and diffing against the real DOM
 * Re-render will not trigger without setState
`,

`# Don't mutate the rendered DOM!

 * Changes to the DOM will be thrown away, or could cause React to break in unexpected ways
 * Any updates to state will automatically trigger a re-render`,

`# Who owns the state?

 * That depends.
 * Containers own state, presentational components only use props
 * Single-page apps generally store the state in a global store`,

`# Toolchain basics`,

`# Gulp`,
`# ESLint`,
`# Babel`,
`# Browserify / Webpack`,

`# Let's build a search panel!`
